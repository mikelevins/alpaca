A programmable editor.

## A new version of Alpaca

I am currently experimenting with an updated implementation of Alpaca
based on the qtools library:

  https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools

I had been thinking about it for a while, but had trouble getting
CommonQt and qtools to install and work properly. Luckily, I found
that the author of qtools, Nicolas Hafner, was more than happy to help
me with my setup, and I've now got it building and working on both OS
X and Linux.

I've barely begun to work on Alpaca itself. A dozen years ago it was a
programmable text editor and word processor that combined features
like pagination and rich-text page layout with the utilities and
programmability of Emacs-style editors. I used it to write a novel.

That version of Alpaca ran only on OS X. For some time I've been
wanting to bring it up-to-date and get it working on Linux and
Windows, too. Doing that means almost a complete rewrite, but it seems
like a worthwhile goal.

Thanks to the help from Nicolas Hafner, I've now started tinkering
with it in earnest.
