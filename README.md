# _Alpaca_

_Description: A programmable editor and word processor for the Mac, written in Common Lisp_

# About

This project is a work in progress, an updated version of the Alpaca
text editor and word processor, first distributed circa 2002. Alpaca
combines a user interface and features familiar to users of OS X
(standard OSX menus and other affordances, page-oriented WYSIWYG
views, and so on) with a built-in Lisp environment and APIs for
customizing the editor.

Alpaca was originally designed to combine certain features of Mac word
processors with certain features from Emacs, in order to facilitate
work on a book.
